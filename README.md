# Project_Leviathan - A Web design final
This was a website created for a final assignment in a web design course in 2020. Completed during my 
second semester in college, this site was meant to resemble a storefront of items. I was told i could make it anything
from a clothing shop to something completely nonsensical. I decided of course to make a parody of "Acme"

Selling every gadget you'd need for any scheme, "Hackme" Co. founder "Fawks E. Wulf" offers things from bait, to gadgets, to DIY projects
for all your schemes.
